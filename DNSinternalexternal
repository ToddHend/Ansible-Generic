## 1. Internal DNS Servers

### Zones Hosted:
- `corp.domain.com`
- `ad.domain.com`
- `int.domain.com`

### Characteristics:
- Not accessible externally
- Hosted on Windows Server DNS or BIND within secure LAN
- Integrated with Active Directory for SRV and Kerberos records
- Forwarders set to upstream external DNS (e.g., 8.8.8.8 or DoH provider)

---

## 2. External DNS Servers

### Zones Hosted:
- `domain.com`
- `www.domain.com`
- `vpn.domain.com`

### Characteristics:
- Hosted with registrar (e.g., Cloudflare, GoDaddy)
- NO internal records exposed (e.g., no internal IPs or AD SRV records)
- Only public-facing records published (A, CNAME, MX, SPF, DKIM, etc.)
- Change control enforced via [your DNS provider] dashboard

## 3. Security Assurance: Demonstrating Segregation

| Control                  | Evidence                                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| No internal zones public | WHOIS/Dig shows only public records externally          |
| Separate authoritative servers | Internal DNS servers only answer LAN queries       |
| AD integration scope     | `_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.domain.com` scoped only internally|
| Firewall rules           | External DNS IPs blocked from internal zone traffic     |
| DNS logging              | Internal zones queried only from internal subnets       |

---

## 4. Additional Notes

- All internal name resolution is forced through DHCP-assigned internal resolvers.
- External users use public DNS resolvers (e.g., Cloudflare 1.1.1.1) and are **not allowed** to reach internal records.
- Split-brain DNS is avoided â€” zones are uniquely defined per environment.
